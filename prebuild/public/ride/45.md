So I decided on a trip to Ginny's.\n\nSet off early to be back for 'family stuff' - the weather was glorious but with a little breeze... so needed arm and knee warmers at the start. Gorge was its usual magnificent spectacle in the sun, albeit with more sheep for some reason, as was the run across the Mendips to Nunney.\n\nSkirted the bottom of Frome for the climb up Forest Road to Horningsham on the edge of the Longleat Estate. From there a super run down to Sutton Veney and then one of my favourite stretches of road to Ginny's at 81km - sausage bap and a coffee for brekkie hit the spot nicely. After the stop it just got better - the road down the Wylye Valley to Wilton is glorious and the climb out again is equally lovely as is the road up the Chalke valley.\n\nTook in the big Climb up to Donhead and back down Zig-Zag hill into Shatesbury - passed up a coffee here but stopped in Gillingham. The run to Bruton is always a struggle for some reason but once past there had a blast back to Glastonbury - where the 'swampies' were out in force.\n\nFinal run across the levels into a headwind was slower than usual... perhaps the enforced lay-offs in May took their toll.\n\nGreat day out - check out the route and steal it if you like - there are some great roads that need riding!\n","Ride_Number":2,"Series":"4 Period Q2 2023 to Q3 2023","Strava_id":9139083383,"id":45}
