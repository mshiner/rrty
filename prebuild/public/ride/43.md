Decided to reprise a route from '21 with a few changes.\n\nStarted early (6:20am) and it wasn't raining - thank the Lord. However that changed 10km in, on the Kingsway to Mark, and it was pretty much drizzle or rain for the next 160km - plus pretty windy at times.\n\nThe section from Cadbury the Sherborne is lovely, but not so much today - I was glad to get to the Pear Tree Deli for a coffee and egg on toast. This one comes well recommended\n\nOn to the Giant (ee's well 'ard, no?) and was still WET, as were the climbs and descents back to the A37 at Chinnock - this would be a lovely section in the dry with some stunning views but today it was totally hidden by low cloud and rain.\n\nAgain I was glad of a sit down at the Feed Station in Merriott although the eye popping prices temper any recommendation.\n\nFrom there to home it was tail wind all the way, although the rain started again at Burrowbridge and came down pretty heavily at the end.\n\nSo that is it - RRtY x 3 in the bag!\n","Ride_Number":12,"Series":"3 Period Q2 2022 to Q1 2023","Strava_id":8798597197,"id":43}
