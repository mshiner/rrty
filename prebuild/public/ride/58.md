WHAT!!!??? My DIY ride is far, FAR more important than a buch of luvvies prancing around in silly costumes. Had a think and decided to divert up the climb to Westbury Quarry (and no, before you mention it, I wasn't going to attempt Draycott Steep - I'm not that stupid) to rejoin my route at Priddy. The road across the Mendips from Priddy all the way to Leigh-on-Mendip was misty with damp roads.\n\nOnce at Nunney the mist cleared and I took the ridgeway road up and over heading for Gare Hill - this is a lovely climb and you are rewarded with a great descent into Bruton.\n\nCoffee and toast at Castle Cary, follwed by the lovely run to Sherborne, then back into Somerset and on to Crewkerne for a second cuppa (and Tiffin!). \n\nFrom there the route was what you Audax Bristol chaps would call 'Rainbow Flat' - flat.... except when its not. I made good progress until Bridgwater (does this place have ANY redeeming features) where the rain started and the traffic seemed a bit more manic than usual. I was glad to get off the main roads and skirted around to the cycle path at Bawdrip, up over Wooly Hill and home.\n\nJuly done - 3 to go for RRtY #4.","Ride_Number":9,"Series":"5 Audax Season 2023-24","Strava_id":11970603071,"id":58}
