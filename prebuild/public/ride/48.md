Having only done 117km for the whole of August due to family issues, I was a little nervous how the legs would hold up given that a trip to Lyme always involves a relatively lumpy route.\n\nThe day started well with a flat run to the Poldens and then on to the A358 near West Hatch where we hit the bottom of the Blackdowns. Unfortunately that is where the rain started! Lumps and bumps across the top on what was a lovely route were improved by the sun breaking through. A coffee stop at the Starbucks on the A35 near Axminster was welcome at this point. The next 15km into Lyme was great, although it was too busy for an ice cream when we got there, so we dragged ourselves through Uplyme on the the back roads to a small farm shop at Tytherleigh near Chard. The remainder of the ride was relatively flat with 2/3 of the climbing in the first half, although both of us were tired and needed plenty of mini breaks.... perhaps that was our undoing as neither of felt we'd eaten enough by the end.\n\nThe last climb at Compton Dundon was short and sharp with a run down to Glastonbury, Wells and back to Wedmore. I left Guy at Axbridge for the run back down the A38 and the finish.\n\nA great day out to complete 48 x 200km in a row (even in 7 were not officially validated due to the Covid insanity).","Ride_Number":5,"Series":"4 Period Q2 2023 to Q3 2023","Strava_id":9735476189,"id":48}
