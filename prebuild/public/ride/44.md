The first part was mainly into a northerly headwind to Long Ashton with a climb up through the estate and then across the bridge.\n\nLooped through Clifton, Blaise Castle and then headed for Almondsbury - was nearly derailed by a road closure but got through before Openreach were set up!\n\nThe highlight of the morning was a nice climb up from Tockington on Washingpool Road! Arrived at Warmley Station - big Queue and no tables where I could see the bike so headed on to Bitton... much quieter (apart from the old biddy who admonished me for leaving my bike 'on the platform') and I found a nice seat in the sun.\n\nCycle path-\u003etwo tunnels heading for Midford hill and then lanes/Mells/Nunney the final big climb up Gare Hill. The descent to Bruton through the Brewhams is amazing - perfect gradient, good sight lines and no traffic - the hammer was well and truly down .\n\nFinal coffee stop at Castle Cary before the flat-ish blast home with a cross/tailwind.","Ride_Number":1,"Series":"#4","Strava_id":8913667247,"id":44}
