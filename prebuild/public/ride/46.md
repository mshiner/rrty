Then the first cycle path down to Radstock before heading out again to Wellow. Planned to stop at the rider centre but it looked a bit busy so pressed on to the Two Tunnels Greenway and.... ooops, no lights so had to take it steady through the tunnels.\n\nThe Bristol-Bath path was quiet so I stopped at Bitton station for a coffee and a bite. From there I looped around the top of Bristol and through Clifton to the Suspension Bridge. I was flagging a bit by now but came across a new coffee stop (for me) at Failand.\n\nThe 60km back from there via Clevedon was a bit of a trial as the wind had got up. It was punctuated, however, buy a stop for a sit down at Kenn AND lending a hand to a lady (Michelle I think her name was) who'd managed to slip her chain off the rear cassette where it had jammed between it and the frame. My first experience with thru axles confused a little but we got it sorted.\n\nAll in all - a good day out that went better than I expected.\n","Ride_Number":3,"Series":"4 Period Q2 2023 to Q3 2023","Strava_id":9357511291,"id":46}
