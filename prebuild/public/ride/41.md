Got it going at the depart... phew.\n\nJoined by GB for the 50km to Sutton Veny where he decided to call it a day and head back to the start.\n\nLoads of standing water everywhere and it pissed down. Maybe he made the right decision.\n\nSecond issue - dropped my Rapha pouch at the info control 773km. Didn't realise until Broad Chalke control at 85km. Saved by a guy called Ray who'd picked it up!\n\nJoined by David (Nash?) from BC to Bruton. Then had a problem with my mudguards so had to stop - sorted with cable ties. Rode from Wells to Wedmore and on from there with two mad 'uns from Winchester - Todd and Rob.\n\nHad a great day, despite the minor (and one potential MAJOR) issues.","Ride_Number":10,"Series":"#3","Strava_id":8392522096,"id":41}
