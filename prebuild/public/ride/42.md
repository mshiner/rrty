Climb up the gorge was 'damp' as was the run to Mells... lovely as usual and the sun made an all too brief appearance when I got there.\n\nCycle path to Radstock and back up to Wellow in the dry but I was by then soaked through. Fantastic Brekkie at the rider centre cafe (Italian Porchetta Panini !) served up by the Scouser-Italian owner.\n\nFrom there cycle path to Bath and all the way around Bristol. At Thornbury the wind REALLY got going and the 90km from there was a bit of a slog TBH, broken up by a coffee in The Old Library at Long Ashton.\n\nBang on 200km as the Garmin doesn't record the two tunnels - the route said 201.6km which seems about right.","Ride_Number":11,"Series":"#3","Strava_id":8583040783,"id":42}
