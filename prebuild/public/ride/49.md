The ride was then interrupted by a curve ball from home - I was assured that I should continue but I resolved not to have a cafe stop and made do with a lovely slice of quiche and a can from the shop in Shepton Beauchamp.\n\nOnwards towards the Quantocks and a climb up to Broomfield. By now the wind was up and it was a bit of a cold slog - rewarded by a descent into Bridg down Dancing Hill.\n\nFinal wiggle up and over the Poldens and a tail wind home.","Ride_Number":6,"Series":"4 Period Q2 2023 to Q3 2023","Strava_id":9951052179,"id":49}
