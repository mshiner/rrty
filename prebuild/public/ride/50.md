The blast down Torhole Bottom was great and I was really getting going and looking forward to coffee at the ESR in Cranbrook. Then at 72km an oncoming horse rider was unseated by a horse about 50 metres in front to me - horse bolted and the rider landed on the verge. When the emergency services arrived they got her to her feet so all seemed OK.... phew. But - 50 minute delay I could've done without as I was slow.\n\nCoffee at ESR 10km later, then a blast down to Crewkerne with a tail wind for a second coffee stop circa 150km. All going well and I made up time by shortening the stops. However, plans went pear shaped at Muchelney as the road to Langport was closed due to flooding - a 5km detour. Not so bad as the North-Westerly head wind dropped a little and the nearly full moon lit up a clear sky.\n\nStarted to flag a bit by the time the Poldens came into view from High Ham but kept going slowly and made it in relatively good time.\n\nAll in all good to be back on the wagon.","Ride_Number":1,"Series":"5 Audax Season 2023-24","Strava_id":10275900527,"id":50}
