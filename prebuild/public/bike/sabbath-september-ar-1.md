{"Bike_Name":"Sabbath September AR-1","Current":"Yes","Frame_Material":"Titanium","Information":"My main Audax machine. Its like riding a magic carpet the ride is that good.\n\nCurrent spec has Ultegra mechs, Rotor cranks, GRX levers, blue Hope calipers and Ti finishing kit. In the winter I run a Hunt 4Season SuperDura Disc wheelset with a Son Edulux Dynamo front wheel. In the high summer, when the Dyno isn't required, a lighter set of Hunt SL Disc wheels are fitted to give a bit of faster ride."}
