When I'm not riding, being opinionated or drinking belgian beer I do 'business' stuff.

### Serial Entrepreneur

Over the years I've been involved with several manufacturing and on-line product businesses as an owner and director. I've also helped other small business owners strategically and with exit planning. Contact me [here](mailto:martyn@chessels.co.uk).

### Consultant uzERP

When wearing my 'IT consulting' hat I help small companies with IT issues involving data, operations and accounting.

I developed, in conjunction with others, the Open Source ERP system __uzERP__. You can find more info [here](https://www.uzerp.com) and [here](https://github.com/uzerpllp/uzerp) or send me an [email](mailto:mhiner@uzerp.com).
